template for my obsidian study vault

# setup
You can simply clone this github repository.
~~You will also need the Dataview and Tasks community plugins for it to work properly.
In the Dataview plugin enable JavaScript queries and enable inline JavaScript queries.
Now you are ready to go!~~

# usage
Firstly you will have to copy the `example_course.md` file and rename it for every course you want to keep here.

Then you will have to copy paste the chapters of your course, make them all a task (by simply writing `- [ ]` in front of it) and then paste the table after it (if you want it).

And that's all!
